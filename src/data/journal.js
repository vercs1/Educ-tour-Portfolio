    excerpt: 'DAY 2 - A training center specializing in IT and networking certification courses such as Cisco CCNA/CCNP, Linux, security, and VoIP.',

For someone in Electronics Engineering, it can be a useful complement if you\'re looking to build skills in networking, infrastructure, or IT-hardware integration, but it may not provide the full breadth of electronics engineering topics (like analog/digital circuit design, embedded systems, power electronics). In student forums, its networking courses are noted as "good for getting your foot in the door" for IT roles. In short: good for IT/network side of electronics, less ideal if your goal is full electronics design engineering. If you like, I can check whether they have any dedicated electronics hardware/embedded systems course track.',
